# stratvision
StratVision is an open-source software developed during a doctoral thesis research in the Federal University of Parana State, Brazil.
StratVision is an environment developed for the formalization of the chess strategic vision. The strategic vision is the abbility a chess player has to identify a pattern even in very different positions.
The StratVision has the following modules:
1. PATLAN (Pattern Language Specification) - written in Javacc; 
2. PATLAN Interpreter;
3. PATLAN Editor;
4. StratVision search module - used to find the pattern described with PATLAN in chess game databases or specific positions.

UPDATE: StratVision is under a rebuild from scratch in order to be more user friendly and to get best performance.
